# tabl less

This command lets you view a delimited text file in a TUI paging environment. It operates very similarly to the less command. You can scroll through rows and columns. You can also set certain columns to be "sticky", which sets them to be permanently visible while you scroll.

## Usage

`$ tabl less [filename] {options}`  
    
*If `filename` is not given, stdin is assumed. Use `-` to explicitly read from stdin.*
## Options

* `--min`           -- the minimum width for a column
* `--max`           -- the maximum width for a column  
*(by default, the width is auto determined)*

## Common options
* `--csv`            -- the file is a CSV file
* `--no-header`      -- the file doesn't contain a header row
* `--header-comment` -- the header is the last commented line (not common, but used sometimes in bioinformatics, eg. VCF format)

## Example

    $ tabl less iris.txt

![tabl less](/assets/img/tabl-less.png)

## In-program commands

    m,Enter           Mark a line
    x                 Select "sticky" columns
                      To select sticky columns, use 
                      arrow keys and hit space to toggle on/off.
                      Hit ESC to exit "sticky-select" mode.
